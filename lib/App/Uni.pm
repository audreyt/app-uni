=head1 NAME

App::Uni - Command-line utility to grep UnicodeData.txt

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.02 of App::Uni, released December 10, 2009.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ uni smiling
    263A ☺ WHITE SMILING FACE
    263B ☻ BLACK SMILING FACE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module installs a simple program, F<uni>, that helps grepping through
the Unicode database included in the current Perl 5 installation.

The arguments to the F<uni> program are joined with space and interpreted
as a regular expression.  Character codes or names matching the regex
(case-insensitively) are then printed out.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is a re-implementation of a same-named program Larry copied to me,
which accompanied me for years.  However, that program was lost during a
hard disk failure, so I coded it up from memory.

Thank-you, Larry, for everything. ♡
