=head1 NAME

App::Uni - Command-line utility to grep UnicodeData.txt

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version v0.14.0 of App::Uni, released June 7, 2011.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ uni smiling face
    263A ☺ WHITE SMILING FACE
    263B ☻ BLACK SMILING FACE

    $ uni ☺
    263A ☺ WHITE SMILING FACE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module installs a simple program, F<uni>, that helps grepping through
the Unicode database (bundled with this distribution).

The arguments to the F<uni> program are joined with space and interpreted
as a regular expression.  Character codes or names matching the regex
(case-insensitively) are then printed out.

If the argument is a single character, then the character itself is also
printed out in addition to code and name matches.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is a re-implementation of a same-named program Larry copied to me,
which accompanied me for years.  However, that program was lost during a
hard disk failure, so I coded it up from memory.

Thank-you, Larry, for everything. ♡
