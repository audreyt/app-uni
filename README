        $ uni ‚ò∫
        263A ‚ò∫ WHITE SMILING FACE

        $ uni wry
        1F63C üòº CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE

DESCRIPTION
    This module installs a simple program, uni, that helps grepping through
    the Unicode database included in the current Perl 5 installation.

    The arguments to the uni program are joined with space and interpreted
    as a regular expression. Character codes or names matching the regex
    (case-insensitively) are then printed out.

    If the argument is a single non-ASCII character, then the character
    itself is printed instead.

NOTES
    If you'd like to search for Emojis in Unicode 6.0, please upgrade to
    Perl 5.14! See <http://www.perlbrew.pl> for one possible way to build a
    local Perl 5.14.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This is a re-implementation of a same-named program Larry copied to me,
    which accompanied me for years. However, that program was lost during a
    hard disk failure, so I coded it up from memory.

    Thank-you, Larry, for everything. ‚ô°
