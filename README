NAME
    App::Uni - Command-line utility to grep UnicodeData.txt

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of App::Uni, released December 10,
    2009.

SYNOPSIS
        $ uni smiling
        263A ☺ WHITE SMILING FACE
        263B ☻ BLACK SMILING FACE

DESCRIPTION
    This module installs a simple program, uni, that helps grepping through
    the Unicode database included in the current Perl 5 installation.

    The arguments to the uni program are joined with space and interpreted
    as a regular expression. Character codes or names matching the regex
    (case-insensitively) are then printed out.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This is a re-implementation of a same-named program Larry copied to me,
    which accompanied me for years. However, that program was lost during a
    hard disk failure, so I coded it up from memory.

    Thank-you, Larry, for everything. ♡
