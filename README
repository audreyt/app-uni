NAME
    App::Uni - Command-line utility to grep UnicodeData.txt

VERSION
    This document describes version v0.12.0 of App::Uni, released April 13,
    2010.

SYNOPSIS
        $ uni smiling face
        263A ☺ WHITE SMILING FACE
        263B ☻ BLACK SMILING FACE

        $ uni ☺
        263A ☺ WHITE SMILING FACE

DESCRIPTION
    This module installs a simple program, uni, that helps grepping through
    the Unicode database included in the current Perl 5 installation.

    The arguments to the uni program are joined with space and interpreted
    as a regular expression. Character codes or names matching the regex
    (case-insensitively) are then printed out.

    If the argument is a single character, then the character itself is also
    printed out in addition to code and name matches.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This is a re-implementation of a same-named program Larry copied to me,
    which accompanied me for years. However, that program was lost during a
    hard disk failure, so I coded it up from memory.

    Thank-you, Larry, for everything. ♡
